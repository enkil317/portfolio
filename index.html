              <h2>About Enkil</h2>
                <p>While managing warehouse environments I enjoyed putting projects together with team mates and working diligently on the human connections to form good 
                  bonds and strong thriving networkship between the ranks. I did a lot of good for the company which got me wondering, how much I could do in my field
                  of interest.</p>
                  <p>I have always had a major passion and interest in technology and design. I enjoy meeting new faces, sharing, and collanorating on new ideas. 
                  I love to learn from all people And that's where Thinkful comes in.
                  Where else can I learn software engineering as well as have access to all kinds of new different and like minded people!?</p>
